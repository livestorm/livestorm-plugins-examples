# Livestorm plugin Vue CLI

![Vue CLI example](https://github.com/livestorm/livestorm-plugins-examples/blob/master/vue-cli/example.png?raw=true)

The goal of this plugin is to show that it is possible to use Vue CLI inside a Livestorm in order to benefit from its advantages.

If you are interested in building a plugin using Vue CLI, we recommend you to start with a fresh install of a Vue CLI project since you will probably want to customize it.

If you do so, don't forget to disable the file name hashing option as explained in the [documentation](https://developers.livestorm.co/docs/templating#disable-the-file-name-hashing-option)

```
// vue.config.js

/**
 * @type {import('@vue/cli-service').ProjectOptions}
 */
module.exports = {
  "filenameHashing": false,
}
```
